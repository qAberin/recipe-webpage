    <p>This macaroni and cheese—this pot of creamy, gooey, cheesy, glorious macaroni and cheese—was made with three ingredients in about 10 minutes. All three ingredients are staples, with shelf lives of weeks or months, which means that a simple lunch is always on hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>6 ounces (180ml) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>6 ounces (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese or any good melting cheese (Fontina, Gruyère, or Jack)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes: </h3>
    <p>If you are willing to kick the total ingredients up to more than three, try a good dash of hot sauce, some mustard powder, or a little knob of butter stirred in with the evaporated milk.</p>
